Goal:

A simple, clean, functional authentication mechanism that
will let any user input their username and a password
so that inserts can be "authorized". This will let
the database tie input to users, and only allow the 
authorized users to input data. 

Issues:

How to get user info into a script?
User a db for userinfo?
Secure transmission.
Input validation

TODO:

Ask around for pre-existing tools.
Make authorization a class?
Decide on auth store and create a process for maintaining it.
Identify what files need authorization.
