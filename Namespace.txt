Issues:

Well, not sure how how work namespaces 
 - Need to figure out where the files go
 - How they are called 
 - How to organize repo and project (makhidkarun) to 
    best use namespaces and reuse code.
 - Look at composer for dependencies?

Initial Resolution:

Put test_Trooper.php and autoload.php in the parent directory. 
 - Make autoload.php str_replace '\' for '/'
Put "namespace NPC_Generator;" in the files in NPC_Generator

TODO:

Look at the SPL autoload.
 - How is it installed on a RHEL/CentOS box?
