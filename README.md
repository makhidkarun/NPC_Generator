Traveller_Mercenary_Generator
===============================

Generates Military /Mercenary units for the Traveller RPG.

If you put in a web site it will give you a page. You can 
change some of the specs for that unit if you want.

You can also call it from the command line and pipe the 
output to a page.

17 Aug 13. Added create_mercenary_unit_json.php. It will 
create a file, 'mercenary.js', that is JSON formatted. There
should be over 10,000 lines in the file and it appends. So 
if you want a *really* large pool to draw from...

08 Oct 13. Added "Issues" to be worked on.
