NPC Generator
=============

Loosely based on the Classic Traveller Role Playing Game, circa
1978-1981. This program creates a non-player character (NPC) using
the same skills a PC would gain. However, it does not strictly follow
the tables.

Classes
-------

Being - Root class
 All sentients have a UPP (6 character hexidecimal string). 
 The UPP codifies physical, mental, and social capabilities.
 Modifiers are sometimes based on the UPP. For example, if 
   UPP the 4th character in the UPP is 0xA or better, you might
   allow a +1 on a random event.
 The UPP can be modified later.
 A being will almost always have a gender, a name, and a list
   of skills. 
 A being will often have Awards. Medals in the case of military,
   citations or other recognitions from civilian pursuits.

Trooper - Basic Mercenary, extends Being
 A trooper will have a rank. 
 The rank will influence what skills the trooper can have.
 The age of the trooper influences the number of skills.
 A trooper can have earned Combat Service Ribbons, Wound Badges, and 
   Medals for bravery. 
 A trooper has a morale score that is heavily influenced by Awards. 

TrooperParams, NCOParams - Modifiers for the randomness in Trooper
 A Trooper is a junior enlisted. Age, rank modifiers.
 An NCO is a mid-grade or higher enlisted. Older, extra skill tables.
 Called in the Trooper __construct as (MilitaryRoleAbstract $role).

Dice - Random number generators
 Mainly used to generate 2 randoms and add them. Better follows the 2d6
   nature of Traveller vice a random int from 2-12.

Decoration - Awards, Medals, Citations
 An array with elements and nested arrays to cover whatever type of award
   a being might get. 
 ?? Nested and non-nested ??
 Called by Trooper to provide awards.
 Heavily influenced by Object->properties.
